# Introduction
The KEEPrivate mainly helps users to use Incognito Mode in Chrome efficiently and conveniently. The KEEPrivate provide the following features:
 - Open the current page in Incognito Mode by simply click
 - Remove session cookies / all cookies related with the current page
 - Remove the browsing history of the current page
 - Remove the Recent Closely history of the current page 
 - Block third-party trackers by blocking the third-party cookies and JavaScript
 - Close the previous page
 - Close the previous window
 - Open all the page in the same Incognito window
 - Double click to open all the pages in incognito window
 - Blacklist(Any website containing the key words will automatically open in incognito mode)


# Motivation

According to our survey, we found that most users misunderstand the true protections of private browsing mode. The following aspects stop many users from benefitting from the Incognito Mode:
 - Complex operation
 - Users cannot customize the options of Incognito Mode
 - Incognito Mode doesn't remove the cookies/histories set by the current page before moving to Incognito Mode
 - Incognito Mode doesn't block trackers which means that the third parties can still collect information for advertisement
In order to align the users' expectations with the Incognito Mode, we proposed and implemented the web extension called KEEPrivate.

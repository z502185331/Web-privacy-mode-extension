# Introduction
The KEEPrivate mainly helps users to use Incognito Mode in Chrome efficiently and conveniently. The KEEPrivate provide the following features:
 - Open the current page in Incognito Mode by simply click
 - Remove session cookies / all cookies related with the current page
 - Remove the browsing history of the current page
 - Remove the Recent Closely history of the current page 
 - Block third-party trackers by blocking the third-party cookies and JavaScript
 - Close the previous page
 - Close the previous window
 - Open all the page in the same Incognito window
 - Double click to open all the pages in incognito window
 - Blacklist(Any website containing the key words will automatically open in incognito mode)


# Motivation

According to our survey, we found that most users misunderstand the true protections of private browsing mode. The following aspects stop many users from benefitting from the Incognito Mode:
 - Complex operation
 - Users cannot customize the options of Incognito Mode
 - Incognito Mode doesn't remove the cookies/histories set by the current page before moving to Incognito Mode
 - Incognito Mode doesn't block trackers which means that the third parties can still collect information for advertisement.

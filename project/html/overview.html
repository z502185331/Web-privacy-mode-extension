            <h1>Cookies</h1>
            <p>An HTTP cookie (also called web cookie, Internet cookie, browser cookie or simply cookie), is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in the user's web browser while the user is browsing it. Every time the user loads the website, the browser sends the cookie back to the server to notify the user's previous activity. KEEPrivate provides the option of blocking third party cookie or seesion cookies, which depneds on the customer's need :</p>
          </div>
          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
              <li><b>Session Cookie</b></li>
              <p>A session cookie, also known as an in-memory cookie or transient cookie, exists only in temporary memory while the user navigates the website.[13] Web browsers normally delete session cookies when the user closes the browser.Unlike other cookies, session cookies do not have an expiration date assigned to them, which is how the browser knows to treat them as session cookies.</p>
              <li class = "list2"><b>Third party Cookie</b></li>
              <p>Normally, a cookie's domain attribute will match the domain that is shown in the web browser's address bar. This is called a first-party cookie. Third-party cookies, however, belong to domains different from the one shown in the address bar. These sorts of cookies typically appear when web pages feature content, such as banner advertisements, from external websites. This opens up the potential for tracking the user's browsing history, and is often used by advertisers in an effort to serve relevant advertisements to each user. </p>

            <div class="row2">
